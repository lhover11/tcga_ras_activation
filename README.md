# Project to try to detect RAS Activation

Trying to use machine learning to detect which samples have Ras Activation using methods as described in Way et al, 2018 Machine Learning Detects Pan-cancer Ras Pathway Activation in The Cancer Genome Atlas

For starters, I will use the PAAD TCGA dataset as this cohort has a high proportion of samples with RAS activation (RAS mutations or amplifications)

All data was downloaded from UCSC Xena in January 2025
